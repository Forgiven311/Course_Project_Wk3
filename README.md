# List of Files in the Repository


The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.

The run_analysis.R is the script that has been used for this work. 

The result of the executing the above script is that a "TidyData.txt" file will be created, that stores the data (mean and standard deviation of each measurement per activity & subject) for later analysis.
